Daksh's research aims to optimize nanofabrication and characterization techniques through the integration of machine learning with nano-, quantum photonics, plasmonic, and optical metamaterials. His focus is on studying the effect of topology variations on metamaterials and understanding the optical and physical properties of solid-state materials. By developing high-efficiency, reconfigurable, semiconductor-compatible devices, Daksh aims to contribute to a variety of applications, including integrated circuits, data storage, sensing, energy conversion, and quantum computing. Ultimately, Dakshâ€™s goal is to conduct meaningful research with a strong foundation in the quantum behavior of materials.
