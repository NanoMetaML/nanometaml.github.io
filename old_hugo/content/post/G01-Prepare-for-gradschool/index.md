    She was last seen in Queens not four nights ago. A child, no older than 10, fell asleep under the warm light of his desk lamp. The dull yellow pencil rolled from his loose hold onto the desk and clattered on the hardwood below. 
    She gently opened his resting left hand, floated a freshly sharpened #2 in his palm, and leaned into his left ear. She softly whispered the story of the world in his ear. The birth of the universe, the dinosaurs, the chemistry of life, and the beautiful mathematics. Then, she let him forget. She left a hunger in his mind that he will search the rest of his life learning to satisfy. He awoke and she was gone.

A romantic idea for sure. Academia should be wherever life, education, and the love of knowledge take place. It shouldn't be confined to the ivory tower. However, to justify a profession in academia, money has to come into the picture. If you want a career in academia, then I'm sorry to say but your pickings are slim. It's hyper competitive and we graduate a lot of PhD's for not a lot of positions. However, that doesn't mean that a) it's impossible or b) you can't be an 'academic'. In fact, you can be an academic at the end of the sentence if you'd like. An academic is anyone who contributes to the 'useful' knowledge of humanity. You can create a lot of useless knowledge, but an academic is someone who strives to create useful knowledge that humanity can act on. So, if you'd like to be a good academic, here is what you'll need.


## For those who want a checklist
Here's my magic recipe.

1. Do a good research project.
2. Lead and teach in your area. 
3. Build an online presence.
    1. Build a webpage for your research.
    2. Share your lecture notes online in a blog.
4. Get your C.V. polished. 
    1. Earn some awards and fellowships (SURF, REU, etc.)

## The Truth about an academic career


Academia is highly competitive. There are only a few spots open available to too many Ph.D.s. However, the spirit of academia doesn't only exist in university. If you love the pursuit and facilitation of knowledge, academia exists wherever you are. 
1. Obtain grant funding to run a lab and help your university.
2. Publish your lab's research in high impact settings.



## The longer version
Why do you want to go to graduate school? Grad school is a lot like that if you do it right.Its primary function is to develop independent researchers. For some, it's scary. You may not think so before starting, but the first time your advisor sends you off on your own, you’ll be terrified. Or at least I was. Maybe you’re a genius prodigy or something. What do I do? How do I know I’m right? There’s so much literature where do I start? These were the questions I would ask myself a lot when I first started. I’ll admit, I’m by no means an expert in this yet. But, I’ve learned a couple of things that might help. 

The first question to ask is, what is grad school? It has a complicated answer. But, I think it’s best to think about grad school as a community. You’re choosing a community to develop your independent research skills. Is it always best to be in the most prestigious community available to you? That depends on your end goal. Going to prestigious institutions has a hidden cost that many don’t see. If you don’t want the stress of being a famous billionaire, why would you be in a community with them? This brings us to the first question you have to ask yourself in choosing the right grad school for you. 

The second question you need to ask yourself is, what do you want to do with your career? Are you interested in pursuing a career in academia, industry, government, or some other field entirely? This is important because different career paths may require different skill sets, experiences, and connections.

Once you have a clear idea of your career goals, the next step is to research potential graduate programs and advisors that align with your interests and goals. Look for programs and advisors who have a strong track record of producing successful graduates in your field of interest. This is more important than department or school prestige.

When considering potential programs and advisors, it's also important to think about the culture and values of the community. Do they value collaboration and teamwork, or is it more competitive and cutthroat? Is there a diverse and inclusive community that celebrates and supports underrepresented groups, or is it homogeneous and exclusive? These are important factors to consider when choosing a community to develop your research skills.

Finally, it's important to remember that graduate school is just one part of your career journey, and it's important to keep an eye on the bigger picture. Think about how your graduate school experience can help you achieve your long-term goals and aspirations, and be open to pivoting your career path if necessary.

## What do you really want to do?
It is good to ask yourself this question often. I came into grad school wanting to work on complexity theory, you know the whole P vs NP thing? I could make a million excuses for why that didn’t pan out. But, the real reason is that I didn’t get into a complexity theory school. So, if I’m not in a community with complexity theorists, what do i do? Well, I still find algorithms and theory really interesting. So, I found another niche. But, enough about me. What do you want? What’s your end goal? Do you want to be a professor? Do you want to be a full time scientist? Do you want to be a patent lawyer? If you don’t get it, is there a close alternative? Life involves a lot of pivoting and finding alternatives. Keep asking yourself what you want and get as close as you can.

If you want to be a good scientist, then I have a sobering pill for you. Good science, I mean the really good, well-respected science, happens at a lot of institutions. It happens at MIT and it happens at Nowhere State University. Good scientists are made by communities. There are bad communities at Caltech and there are good communities at Nowhere State. Good scientists need nurturing communities and I would take a good community at Nowhere State over a bad community at Harvard every single day of the week. 

So, the key is to find the community that aligns with your interests and values, and where you can thrive and grow as a scientist or professional. It may not necessarily be at an elite institution, but it could be at a smaller or less well-known institution with a strong community and supportive environment.

Ultimately, it's important to be honest with yourself about what you really want to do and what makes you happy. Pursue your passions and find the community and environment that can help you achieve your goals and flourish.

Do you really need to go to an elite institution?
That depends on your end goal and what you would do at that elite institution. If you never expose yourself to the community at the elite institution and your end goal doesn’t necessitate a good pedigree, then don’t bother. Do good science wherever you find it. Elite institutions are elite because of the opportunities they bring by attending. If you can take advantage of the opportunities, then it might be worth the stress and negatives associated with elite institutions. If you can’t take advantage, then save yourself the trouble and find a good community in a different Ph.D. program. 

However, it is worth noting that attending an elite institution can provide access to a wide range of resources and networks that may not be available elsewhere. These institutions often have exceptional faculty, extensive research facilities, and a diverse student body, all of which can enhance your learning experience and provide opportunities for collaboration and networking.

Furthermore, attending an elite institution can also carry prestige and credibility that may be valuable in certain fields or industries. This can lead to better job opportunities, higher salaries, and increased visibility in your field.

Ultimately, whether or not you need to attend an elite institution depends on your specific goals and circumstances. It is important to carefully consider the costs and benefits of attending such an institution and weigh them against your personal and professional objectives.

What do good communities bring?
Good communities bring friendship, encouragement, support, and freedom. These are crucial for enjoying science. The best communities push you into other communities. Sasha Boltasseva, my advisor, has given me so many opportunities to build community inside and outside of Purdue. The Nanometa research group I’ve been a part of for 4 years has given me opportunities to work at Oak Ridge, QuEra, Harvard, MIT, and Santa Barbara. Your community opens doors if you live in it.

In addition to these personal benefits, good communities can also provide a wealth of resources and opportunities for professional development. For example, a supportive research group can offer mentorship, collaborations, and access to cutting-edge research tools and technologies. A strong academic community can provide opportunities for networking, attending conferences, and presenting research, which can help advance your career and build your reputation in your field.

Furthermore, good communities can provide a sense of belonging and purpose, which can be especially important for underrepresented groups in science and academia. A diverse and inclusive community can offer role models, allies, and a sense of shared experience that can help overcome barriers and promote equity and inclusion.

Overall, good communities can make all the difference in your personal and professional life. They can provide the support, resources, and sense of belonging you need to thrive as a scientist or professional, and help you achieve your goals and aspirations.

## Grad school should be supplementary
For those who find a lot of success, grad school is a supplemental step to something greater. It should not be the main focus of your life. Read that again. Grad school in and of itself should not be the main focus of your life. Doing good science, living in a community, loving people around you. These should be the main focus of your life. Grad school is just where you do it. You should be able to bring your love of science wherever you go and be content in whatever position you find yourself in. The hedonic treadmill is a bitch and the only remedy is to be content doing science wherever you are.

Graduate school is a stepping stone, a means to an end, and it should not consume your entire life. It's important to maintain a healthy work-life balance and prioritize your physical and mental well-being. Pursue hobbies, spend time with loved ones, and engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of work.

Furthermore, graduate school is just one part of your career journey, and it's important to keep an eye on the bigger picture. Think about your long-term goals and aspirations, and make sure that your work in graduate school is aligned with those goals. Take advantage of opportunities to network and gain experience outside of your immediate research area, and be open to pivoting your career path if necessary.

At the end of the day, graduate school should be a valuable and formative experience, but it should not define you or your life. Keep things in perspective and stay true to your values and priorities, and you will be able to navigate the challenges and opportunities of graduate school with grace and resilience.

## Money is a real concern
Ph.D. programs have been in the spotlight recently for their low wages. Protests and unions have broken out across academia because of unsustainable living conditions on grad school wages. I feel this pressure and I’m a cis-white man with a family that helps out occasionally. I can’t imagine the stress that international and underrepresented groups of people face when it comes to finances in grad school. The truth is that if you are constantly stressed about money, then grad school is going to be much harder. Look into the living conditions of the grad students at the school you are interested in.

Yes, financial concerns can be a major stressor for graduate students, and it's important to be realistic about the cost of living in the area where you will be studying. Before committing to a program, research the average cost of rent, groceries, transportation, and other expenses in the area, and factor in any potential sources of financial support, such as fellowships, grants, or scholarships.

It's also important to be proactive in seeking out financial resources and support. Talk to your department or program about funding opportunities, and reach out to professional organizations or foundations that offer grants or fellowships in your field. Look for part-time work or freelance opportunities that can help supplement your income and gain experience outside of academia.

Furthermore, if you are experiencing financial hardship, don't be afraid to seek help. Many universities offer financial counseling and support services for students, and there are also community resources such as food banks or rental assistance programs that can help alleviate some of the financial burden.

In summary, financial concerns are a real issue for many graduate students, but there are resources and support available to help manage these challenges. Do your research, be proactive in seeking out financial support, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.
